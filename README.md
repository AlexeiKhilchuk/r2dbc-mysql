# Reactive Relational Database Connectivity MySQL Implementation

This project contains the [MySQL][m] implementation of the [R2DBC SPI][s].
This implementation is NOT OFFICIAL, official implementations are all in
[R2DBC Homepage][r], but looks like [R2DBC Github Page][g] has no
[MySQL][m] implementation for now (as of January 3, 2019).

**THIS IS ONLY AN EXPERIMENT AND NOT SUPPORTED SOFTWARE FOR NOW**
