/**
 * Unit tests for ping message, include application level ping {@code SELECT 1}.
 * <p>
 * SQL query {@code SELECT 1} is a ping approach which is cross-database (maybe some are not
 * supported) and is easy to understand.
 * <p>
 * Note: looks like {@code SELECT 1} result value type returned by the MySQL server is BIGINT,
 * try using Number.class to eliminate {@code assertEquals} fail because of the value type.
